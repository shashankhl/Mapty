# Mapty

This is the initial website https://mapty-shashankhl.netlify.app

This is the final website implemented by me https://mapty-final-shashank-hl.netlify.app

After the additional implementation of the project, it features
- Ability to edit the workouts
- Ability to delete the workout
- Ability to deleteAll the workouts
- Ability to sort according to time distance and gyration
And the most advanced features which feature the
- **Geocode Location** from co-ordinates
- **Weather Feature** from open weather API and implementing the cloud view

Mapty is a web application that allows users to track their workouts on an interactive map. It is built using the Leaflet library for map functionality and incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The application provides a user-friendly interface and features visually appealing CSS styling.

## Features

- **Workout Tracking**: Users can track different types of workouts, including running, cycling, and more. The application allows them to specify workout details such as distance, duration, pace, and elevation gain.

- **Interactive Map**: Mapty leverages the Leaflet library to display an interactive map. Users can add workout locations by clicking on the map, and markers are displayed to represent each workout.

- **Workout Details**: The application provides a comprehensive overview of each workout, including distance covered, duration, average pace, and elevation gain. Users can easily access this information by clicking on the workout markers or workout list items.

- **Data Persistence**: Mapty stores workout data in the browser's local storage, ensuring that users' workout history is preserved even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the application's web pages.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for enhancing the application's visual design.
- JavaScript: Programming language used to implement the application's logic and interactivity.
- Leaflet: Open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm used to organize and structure the application's codebase.

  I would finally like to thank @Johnas Schmedtmann for a amazing course in udemy
